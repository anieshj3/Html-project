<p>A hackathon is a short-term event where individuals or teams come together to develop innovative solutions to real-world problems using technology. It usually lasts 24 to 48 hours, during which participants brainstorm ideas, design, and build working prototypes based on a given theme or problem statement. Hackathons are commonly organized by colleges, companies, or organizations to encourage creativity, teamwork, and technical skills. Participants present their projects to judges at the end of the event, and the best solutions may receive prizes, recognition, or even job opportunities. Hackathons help improve problem-solving abilities, collaboration skills, and practical knowledge.</p>

<p>Hackathons also provide a great platform for networking and learning new technologies in a short period of time. Participants get the opportunity to interact with mentors, industry experts, and like-minded peers, which helps in gaining valuable insights and guidance. Even if a team does not win, the experience of building a project under time pressure boosts confidence and enhances practical skills. For students and freshers, hackathons are especially beneficial as they strengthen resumes, showcase talent, and sometimes open doors to internships or full-time job offers.</p>
